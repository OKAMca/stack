# React 19 + Next.js 15 Upgrade Progress

## 2026-01-11 - Task: fix-button-preventfocusonpress

### Completed
- Fixed Button component in `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/Button/index.tsx`
- Added `preventFocusOnPress` to the destructuring on line 76 to filter it out before spreading to DOM elements
- This prevents React 19 from throwing warnings about unknown DOM props

### Changes Made
- Modified line 76 to add `preventFocusOnPress` to destructured props:
  ```typescript
  const { onPress, onFocusChange, excludeFromTabOrder, preventFocusOnPress, ...allProps } = rest as Record<
    string,
    unknown
  >
  ```

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx lint stack-ui` - SUCCESS (only pre-existing warning in AlertsItem.tsx)

### Issues Encountered
- Had to format the line across multiple lines to satisfy prettier line length rules

### Next Tasks
- fix-uselabelledoverlay-preventfocusonpress
- fix-popoverbutton-preventfocusonpress
- fix-datepicker-wrapper-preventfocusonpress
- fix-accordion-preventfocusonpress

## 2026-01-11 - Task: fix-uselabelledoverlay-preventfocusonpress

### Completed
- Fixed useLabelledOverlay hook in `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/hooks/useLabelledOverlay/index.ts`
- Added `preventFocusOnPress` to the destructuring on line 22 to filter it out before spreading to consumers
- useOverlayTrigger returns preventFocusOnPress in triggerProps which was being spread to DOM elements

### Changes Made
- Modified line 22 to add `preventFocusOnPress` to destructured props:
  ```typescript
  const {
    triggerProps: { onPress, preventFocusOnPress, ...triggerProps },
    overlayProps,
  } = useOverlayTrigger({ type }, state, ref)
  ```

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx lint stack-ui` - SUCCESS (only pre-existing warning in AlertsItem.tsx)

### Issues Encountered
- None

### Next Tasks
- fix-popoverbutton-preventfocusonpress
- fix-datepicker-wrapper-preventfocusonpress
- fix-accordion-preventfocusonpress

## 2026-01-11 - Task: fix-popoverbutton-preventfocusonpress

### Completed
- Fixed Popover Button component in `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/Popover/components/Button.tsx`
- Added `preventFocusOnPress` to the destructuring on line 41 to filter it out before spreading to ButtonWithForwardRef
- useOverlayTrigger returns preventFocusOnPress in triggerProps which was being passed to the DOM

### Changes Made
- Modified line 41 to add `preventFocusOnPress` to destructured props:
  ```typescript
  const { onPress, preventFocusOnPress, ...triggerButtonProps } = triggerProps
  ```

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx lint stack-ui` - SUCCESS (only pre-existing warning in AlertsItem.tsx)

### Issues Encountered
- None

### Next Tasks
- fix-datepicker-wrapper-preventfocusonpress
- fix-accordion-preventfocusonpress

## 2026-01-11 - Task: fix-datepicker-wrapper-preventfocusonpress

### Completed
- Fixed DatePicker Wrapper component in `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/fields/DatePicker/components/Wrapper.tsx`
- Added `preventFocusOnPress` filtering from buttonProps before spreading to Button component
- useDatePicker returns buttonProps containing preventFocusOnPress which was being passed to the DOM

### Changes Made
- Added destructuring to filter out preventFocusOnPress:
  ```typescript
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
  const { preventFocusOnPress, onPress, ...restButtonProps } = buttonProps as typeof buttonProps & {
    preventFocusOnPress?: unknown
  }
  ```
- Changed Button props to use restButtonProps instead of buttonProps

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx lint stack-ui` - SUCCESS (only pre-existing warning in AlertsItem.tsx)

### Issues Encountered
- Initial approach using underscore prefix (`_preventFocusOnPress`) violated naming convention lint rule
- Had to add eslint-disable comment for @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars to match other files' patterns
- Prettier auto-fix was applied to format multi-line Button props

### Next Tasks
- fix-accordion-preventfocusonpress

## 2026-01-11 - Task: fix-accordion-preventfocusonpress

### Completed
- Fixed AriaAccordionItem component in `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/Accordion/components/AriaAccordionItem.tsx`
- Added `preventFocusOnPress` filtering from buttonProps before spreading to ButtonWithForwardRef
- useAccordionItem returns buttonProps that may contain preventFocusOnPress which was being passed to the DOM

### Changes Made
- Refactored to first get rawButtonProps, then destructure with type assertion:
  ```typescript
  const { buttonProps: rawButtonProps, regionProps } = useAccordionItem(props, state, ref)
  // Filter preventFocusOnPress to prevent React 19 unknown prop warning
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
  const {
    onClick: onButtonClick,
    onKeyDown,
    onPointerDown,
    preventFocusOnPress,
    ...buttonProps
  } = rawButtonProps as typeof rawButtonProps & {
    preventFocusOnPress?: unknown
  }
  ```

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx lint stack-ui` - SUCCESS (only pre-existing warning in AlertsItem.tsx)

### Issues Encountered
- TypeScript error: `preventFocusOnPress` does not exist on type `ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>`
- Solution: Used type assertion with `& { preventFocusOnPress?: unknown }` pattern (consistent with DatePicker Wrapper)
- Prettier required multi-line formatting for the destructuring

### Next Tasks
- Phase 1 complete! All preventFocusOnPress fixes are done.
- Next: Phase 2 (dependency upgrades) - convert-react-to-peer-deps

## 2026-01-11 - Task: convert-react-to-peer-deps

### Completed
- Converted react and react-dom from dependencies to peerDependencies in stack-ui package.json
- This allows consumers to use either React 18 or React 19 with the library
- Updated eslint configuration to ignore react-dom in dependency checks

### Changes Made
1. Modified `libs/stack/stack-ui/package.json`:
   - Removed `react` from dependencies
   - Added `peerDependencies` section with:
     ```json
     "peerDependencies": {
       "react": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0",
       "react-dom": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"
     }
     ```

2. Modified `libs/stack/stack-ui/.eslintrc.js`:
   - Added `@nx/dependency-checks` rule with `react-dom` in ignoredDependencies
   - This is necessary because react-dom is a peer dependency but not directly imported

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx run-many --all --target=lint` - SUCCESS

### Issues Encountered
- Initial lint failure: `@nx/dependency-checks` flagged react-dom as unused
- Solution: Added react-dom to ignoredDependencies in stack-ui's eslint config
- Had to replicate full dependency-checks config to avoid overriding base config

### Notes
- devDependencies for react/react-dom are handled at the root workspace level (package.json)
- The prd.json mentioned adding them to stack-ui's devDependencies but the workspace already provides React 18.3.1 for development

### Next Tasks
- upgrade-types-react (Phase 2)
- upgrade-types-react-dom (Phase 2)
- upgrade-next (Phase 2)
- upgrade-react-aria (Phase 2)
- upgrade-react-stately (Phase 2)

## 2026-01-11 - Task: fix-jsx-namespace (subtask of upgrade-types-react)

### Completed
- Fixed all JSX.Element references to use React.JSX.Element (required for @types/react@19)
- In React 19 types, the global JSX namespace is removed and must be accessed via React.JSX

### Files Changed
1. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/Accordion/components/AccordionItem.tsx:51`
2. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/Carousel/index.tsx:8` - also added React import
3. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/Menu/interface.ts:14,21`
4. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/SidePanel/interface.ts:11,13` - also added React type import
5. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/TagGroup/components/TagItem.tsx:78` - removed JSX type import
6. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/Node/index.tsx:149` - added React type import
7. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/TabList/components/TabItem.tsx:78` - removed JSX type import
8. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/providers/Menu/interface.ts:13-15,21-23,29-31`
9. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/storybook/Menu/Menu.tsx:87,113`

### Verification
- Build: Runs but has PRE-EXISTING errors (not introduced by this change)
- Lint passed: `npx nx lint stack-ui` - SUCCESS (only pre-existing warning)
- JSX.Element errors are now eliminated

### Issues Encountered
- Discovered that the build was already failing on main branch with TypeScript errors
- These pre-existing errors are related to RefObject types and child.props being unknown
- My JSX namespace changes do not introduce any new errors
- Node/index.tsx required `import type React` instead of `import React` to satisfy lint rule

### Pre-existing Build Errors (NOT related to this task)
- `AlertsItem.tsx:32` - spread types issue with content.props
- `Alerts/index.tsx:33` - RefObject<null> issue
- `useCarouselSlide.tsx:35,46` - RefObject issue
- `combo-box.stories.tsx:211,313` - unknown props issue
- `ComboBox/index.tsx:148,151` - RefObject issue
- `Select/Select.tsx:44` - useRef needs argument

### Next Tasks
- fix-refobject-null (subtask of upgrade-types-react)
- fix-element-props-unknown (subtask of upgrade-types-react)
- apply-types-upgrade (subtask of upgrade-types-react)

## 2026-01-11 - Task: fix-refobject-null (subtask of upgrade-types-react)

### Completed
- Updated RefObject types to accept null (React 19 type change)
- In React 19's @types/react, RefObject<T> no longer implicitly includes null
- useRef<T>(null) now returns RefObject<T | null> instead of RefObject<T>

### Files Changed (from prd.json)
1. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/hooks/useLabelledOverlay/index.ts:18`
   - Changed `RefObject<Element>` to `RefObject<Element | null>`

2. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/Carousel/swiper/useCarouselSlide.tsx:10`
   - Changed function parameter from `RefObject<HTMLElement>` to `RefObject<HTMLElement | null>`

3. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/Carousel/swiper/interface.ts:33,39`
   - Updated TCarouselSwiper.ref to `RefObject<SwiperRef | null>`
   - Updated TCarouselSlide.ref to `RefObject<HTMLElement | null>`

4. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/Popover/interface.ts:31,32`
   - Updated popoverRef to `RefObject<HTMLElement | null>`
   - Updated triggerRef to `RefObject<HTMLElement | null>`

5. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/providers/Carousel/interface.ts:27-29`
   - Updated swiperRef to `RefObject<SwiperRef | null>`
   - Updated prevNavigationRef to `RefObject<(HTMLButtonElement & HTMLAnchorElement) | null>`
   - Updated nextNavigationRef to `RefObject<(HTMLButtonElement & HTMLAnchorElement) | null>`

6. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/Carousel/navigation/interface.ts:13`
   - Updated TCarouselNavigation.ref to `RefObject<(HTMLButtonElement & HTMLAnchorElement) | null>`

7. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/fields/Select/Select.tsx:44`
   - Fixed useRef<HTMLElement>() to useRef<HTMLElement>(null) (React 19 requires argument)

### Verification
- All RefObject-related TypeScript errors are now resolved
- Lint passed: `npx nx run-many --all --target=lint` - SUCCESS (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning)

### Remaining Build Errors (NOT from this task - belong to other subtasks)
- `AlertsItem.tsx:32` - child.props is unknown (fix-element-props-unknown task)
- `combo-box.stories.tsx:211,313` - child.props is unknown (fix-element-props-unknown task)
- `AccordionTransition.tsx:18`, `ModalTransition.tsx:19`, `RenderWithOpacity.tsx:17` - react-spring animated.div children issue (new issue discovered, needs to be added to prd.json)

### Issues Encountered
- The prd.json only listed 3 files, but fixing those revealed cascade effects in other files that also needed updating
- All RefObject types in interfaces that are consumed by useRef(null) needed to be updated

### Next Tasks
- fix-element-props-unknown (subtask of upgrade-types-react)
- apply-types-upgrade (subtask of upgrade-types-react)
- Note: react-spring animated.div type issue should be added to prd.json

## 2026-01-11 - Task: fix-element-props-unknown (subtask of upgrade-types-react)

### Completed
- Fixed child.props which is now 'unknown' in React 19 types
- In React 19's @types/react, ReactElement.props is typed as 'unknown' instead of 'any'
- This requires explicit type casting when accessing props on ReactElement

### Files Changed
1. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/Alerts/components/AlertsItem.tsx:32`
   - Fixed React.cloneElement call by casting content to `React.ReactElement<Record<string, unknown>>`
   - This allows the spread of props while maintaining type safety
   - Comment added explaining React 19 compatibility

2. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/fields/ComboBox/combo-box.stories.tsx:207,298`
   - Fixed line 207: Cast metaChildren to `React.ReactElement<{ children: React.ReactNode }>[]`
   - Fixed line 298: Cast children to `React.ReactElement<any>[]` with eslint-disable comment
   - This allows accessing child.props.children without type errors

### Verification
- AlertsItem.tsx and combo-box.stories.tsx type errors are resolved
- Lint passed (verified by build output showing no errors from these files)

### Issues Encountered
- Initial approach of casting just `content.props as Record<string, unknown>` didn't work
- cloneElement's second argument types based on the element type, so the element itself needed casting
- Discovered additional react-spring animated.div issues (separate from this task)

### New Issues Discovered (added to prd.json)
- react-spring animated.div doesn't accept children prop with React 19 types
- Affected files:
  - AccordionTransition.tsx:18
  - ModalTransition.tsx:19
  - RenderWithOpacity.tsx:17
  - RenderWithSlide.tsx:19
  - SidePanelTransition.tsx:28
- This is tracked as new task: fix-react-spring-animated-children

### Next Tasks
- fix-react-spring-animated-children (new task)
- apply-types-upgrade (subtask of upgrade-types-react)

## 2026-01-11 - Task: fix-react-spring-animated-children (subtask of upgrade-types-react)

### Completed
- Fixed react-spring animated.div not accepting children prop with React 19 types
- In React 19's @types/react, the implicit children prop is removed from FC and component types
- react-spring's AnimatedProps type doesn't include children, causing TypeScript errors

### Files Changed
1. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/transitions/AccordionTransition.tsx`
2. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/transitions/ModalTransition.tsx`
3. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/transitions/RenderWithOpacity.tsx`
4. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/transitions/RenderWithSlide.tsx`
5. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/transitions/SidePanelTransition.tsx`

### Solution Applied
- Created type-cast wrapper for animated.div that accepts any props:
  ```typescript
  // Cast animated.div to accept children prop for React 19 type compatibility
  // react-spring types don't include children in AnimatedProps with @types/react@19
  // See: https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring/issues/1572
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
  const AnimatedDiv = animated.div as React.FC<any>
  ```
- Replaced all `animated.div` usages with `AnimatedDiv`

### Research Findings
- This is a known issue with react-spring's types (GitHub issue #1572)
- react-spring v9.x has peer dependency on React 16/17/18, not officially supporting React 19 yet
- react-spring v10.x was released to address React 19 compatibility
- The `any` cast is a temporary workaround until react-spring updates their types
- Alternative: upgrade to @react-spring/web v10.x, but may introduce breaking changes

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx run-many --all --target=lint` - SUCCESS (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning)

### Issues Encountered
- First attempt using `React.ComponentProps<typeof animated.div>` failed - only included style prop types, not other div attributes
- Second attempt using `ComponentPropsWithRef<'div'>` failed - SpringValue types not compatible with regular CSS types
- Final solution: Cast to `React.FC<any>` to bypass type checking entirely (safe since animated.div already works at runtime)

### Next Tasks
- apply-types-upgrade (subtask of upgrade-types-react) - Apply @types/react ^19.0.0 upgrade

## 2026-01-11 - Task: apply-types-upgrade (subtask of upgrade-types-react)

### Completed
- Upgraded @types/react from 18.2.33 to ^19.0.0 in root package.json devDependencies
- Upgraded @types/react-dom from 18.2.14 to ^19.0.0 in root package.json devDependencies
- This completes the upgrade-types-react and upgrade-types-react-dom tasks

### Changes Made
1. Modified `/Users/marie-maxime/webdev/stack/package.json`:
   - Changed `"@types/react": "18.2.33"` to `"@types/react": "^19.0.0"`
   - Changed `"@types/react-dom": "18.2.14"` to `"@types/react-dom": "^19.0.0"`

2. Ran `npm install` to update dependencies
   - @types/react@19.2.8 installed
   - @types/react-dom@19.2.3 installed

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx run-many --all --target=lint` - SUCCESS (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning)

### Notes
- React and react-dom runtime remain at 18.3.1 for now
- Upgrading runtime to React 19 is blocked by @react-spring/web@9.7.5 which has peer dependency on React 16/17/18
- The types upgrade validates that stack-ui is TypeScript-compatible with React 19
- The peerDependencies already support React 18 and 19: `"react": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"`

### Next Tasks (Phase 2 remaining)
- upgrade-next (Next.js 14 → 15)
- upgrade-react-aria (3.39.0 → 3.45.0)
- upgrade-react-stately (3.37.0 → 3.43.0)
- upgrade-react-spring (@react-spring/web 9.7.5 → 10.0.3) - REQUIRED for full React 19 runtime support

## 2026-01-11 - Task: upgrade-next (phase_2_dependency_upgrades)

### Completed
- Upgraded Next.js from ^14.1.1 to ^15.0.0 across all packages
- Also upgraded eslint-config-next from ^14.0.4 to ^15.0.0

### Files Changed
1. `/Users/marie-maxime/webdev/stack/package.json`
   - Changed `"next": "^14.1.1"` to `"next": "^15.0.0"`
   - Changed `"eslint-config-next": "^14.0.4"` to `"eslint-config-next": "^15.0.0"`

2. `/Users/marie-maxime/webdev/stack/libs/directus/directus-next/package.json`
   - Changed `"next": "^14.1.1"` to `"next": "^15.0.0"`

3. `/Users/marie-maxime/webdev/stack/libs/stack/next-component/package.json`
   - Changed `"next": "^14.1.1"` to `"next": "^15.0.0"`

4. `/Users/marie-maxime/webdev/stack/libs/directus/directus-next-component/package.json`
   - Changed `"next": "^14.1.1"` to `"next": "^15.0.0"`

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx run-many --all --target=lint` - SUCCESS (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning)
- npm install succeeded with Next.js 15 installed

### Issues Encountered
- None

### Next Tasks (Phase 2 remaining)
- upgrade-react-aria (3.39.0 → 3.45.0)
- upgrade-react-stately (3.37.0 → 3.43.0)
- upgrade-react-spring (@react-spring/web 9.7.5 → 10.0.3) - REQUIRED for full React 19 runtime support
- npm-audit-fix

## 2026-01-11 - Task: upgrade-react-aria (phase_2_dependency_upgrades)

### Completed
- Upgraded react-aria from ^3.39.0 to ^3.45.0
- Updated all @react-aria/* and @react-stately/* sub-packages to compatible versions
- Fixed breaking changes introduced by the upgrade

### Files Changed
1. `/Users/marie-maxime/webdev/stack/libs/stack/stack-ui/package.json`
   - Changed `"react-aria": "^3.39.0"` to `"react-aria": "^3.45.0"`
   - Updated all @react-aria/* packages to latest compatible versions:
     - @internationalized/date: 3.8.0 → ^3.10.1
     - @react-aria/checkbox: 3.15.4 → ^3.16.3
     - @react-aria/focus: ^3.19.0 → ^3.21.3
     - @react-aria/i18n: ^3.12.4 → ^3.12.14
     - @react-aria/overlays: 3.27.0 → ^3.31.0
     - @react-aria/tabs: 3.10.2 → ^3.10.9
     - @react-aria/utils: 3.28.2 → ^3.32.0
     - @react-aria/visually-hidden: 3.8.22 → ^3.8.29
   - Updated all @react-stately/* packages:
     - @react-stately/checkbox: 3.6.13 → ^3.7.3
     - @react-stately/collections: 3.12.3 → ^3.12.8
     - @react-stately/overlays: 3.6.15 → ^3.6.21
     - @react-stately/radio: 3.10.12 → ^3.11.3
     - @react-stately/tabs: 3.8.1 → ^3.8.7
     - @react-stately/toggle: 3.8.3 → ^3.9.3
   - Updated @react-types/* packages:
     - @react-types/radio: 3.8.8 → ^3.9.2
     - @react-types/shared: ^3.26.0 → ^3.29.0
     - @react-types/tabs: 3.3.14 → ^3.3.20

2. `/Users/marie-maxime/webdev/stack/libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/fields/Select/Select.interface.ts`
   - Changed `onSelectionChange?: (value: Key) => void` to `onSelectionChange?: (value: Key | null) => void`
   - Breaking change in react-aria: onSelectionChange callback now receives Key | null instead of just Key

3. `/Users/marie-maxime/webdev/stack/libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/TabList/components/TabPanel.tsx`
   - Added `id` to destructuring (filtered out) to prevent type mismatch
   - AriaTabPanelProps.id is `Key | undefined` but TTransition expects `string | undefined`

4. `/Users/marie-maxime/webdev/stack/libs/stack/stack-ui/src/storybook/SelectField/index.tsx`
   - Updated onSelectionChange callback to handle null case

### Breaking Changes Applied
- **onSelectionChange signature change**: Consumers using `onSelectionChange` must now handle `null` values
- This is a minor breaking change but follows react-aria's API evolution

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx lint stack-ui` - SUCCESS (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning)

### Issues Encountered
- TypeScript errors after upgrade due to API changes in react-aria 3.45.0
- onSelectionChange callback signature changed from (Key) => void to (Key | null) => void
- TabPanel id prop type mismatch with TTransition interface
- @nx/dependency-checks lint errors due to mismatched pinned versions

### Next Tasks (Phase 2 remaining)
- upgrade-react-stately (3.37.0 → 3.43.0)
- upgrade-react-spring (@react-spring/web 9.7.5 → 10.0.3) - REQUIRED for full React 19 runtime support
- npm-audit-fix

## 2026-01-11 - Task: upgrade-react-stately (phase_2_dependency_upgrades)

### Completed
- Upgraded react-stately from ^3.37.0 to ^3.43.0
- This is the companion library to react-aria for React 19 compatibility

### Files Changed
1. `/Users/marie-maxime/webdev/stack/libs/stack/stack-ui/package.json`
   - Changed `"react-stately": "^3.37.0"` to `"react-stately": "^3.43.0"`

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx lint stack-ui` - SUCCESS (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning)
- Installed version: react-stately@3.43.0

### Issues Encountered
- Initial `npm install` did not update the locked version
- Had to run `npm update react-stately` to get version 3.43.0 installed
- Lint initially failed with `@nx/dependency-checks` error due to version mismatch

### Next Tasks (Phase 2 remaining)
- upgrade-react-spring (@react-spring/web 9.7.5 → 10.0.3) - REQUIRED for full React 19 runtime support
- npm-audit-fix

## 2026-01-11 - Task: upgrade-react-spring (phase_2_dependency_upgrades)

### Completed
- Upgraded @react-spring/web from ^9.7.5 to ^10.0.3
- This is a major version upgrade that adds official React 19 support
- Removed all temporary type cast workarounds that were no longer needed

### Files Changed
1. `/Users/marie-maxime/webdev/stack/libs/stack/stack-ui/package.json`
   - Changed `"@react-spring/web": "^9.7.5"` to `"@react-spring/web": "^10.0.3"`

2. Removed AnimatedDiv type cast workarounds from 5 transition files:
   - `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/transitions/AccordionTransition.tsx`
   - `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/transitions/ModalTransition.tsx`
   - `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/transitions/RenderWithOpacity.tsx`
   - `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/transitions/RenderWithSlide.tsx`
   - `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/transitions/SidePanelTransition.tsx`

   These files previously had:
   ```typescript
   // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
   const AnimatedDiv = animated.div as React.FC<any>
   ```

   This workaround was removed because v10 properly supports React 19 types and animated.div now accepts children prop natively.

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx run-many --all --target=lint` - SUCCESS (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning)
- TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit` - SUCCESS (no type errors)

### Issues Encountered
- `npm update` doesn't cross major versions, had to use `npm install @react-spring/web@10.0.3` explicitly
- Initial installation showed package at v9.7.5 until explicit install was done

### Breaking Changes Notes
- react-spring v10 introduces React 19 support with the SpringContext API change
- No code changes required for the APIs used (useTransition, animated, config)
- All 5 transition components work identically after upgrade

### Next Tasks (Phase 2 remaining)
- npm-audit-fix (optional - security vulnerabilities)

## 2026-01-11 - Task: run-build (phase_3_testing)

### Completed
- Verified stack-ui builds successfully with all React 19 upgrades
- Removed unused import (CarouselSlide) from AlertsItem.tsx to clear lint warning

### Changes Made
1. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/components/Alerts/components/AlertsItem.tsx`
   - Removed unused `CarouselSlide` import that was causing lint warning

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx lint stack-ui` - SUCCESS (0 errors, 0 warnings)

### Notes
- All phase_1_code_fixes completed successfully
- All phase_2_dependency_upgrades completed successfully
- Build verifies that:
  - TypeScript compiles without errors
  - All React 19 type fixes work correctly
  - react-spring v10 types work without workarounds
  - react-aria v3.45.0 API changes are properly handled

### Next Tasks (Phase 3 remaining)
- run-storybook (verify components render correctly)
- test-overlay-components (SidePanel, Popover, Modal, Dialog)
- test-button-components (Button, ButtonWithForwardRef, Anchor)

## 2026-01-11 - Tasks: run-storybook, test-overlay-components, test-button-components (phase_3_testing)

### Completed
- Started Storybook successfully on port 4400
- Tested all key components in Storybook using Playwright browser automation
- Verified no console warnings about unknown DOM props (like preventFocusOnPress)

### Components Tested
1. **Button** - Renders correctly, no console warnings
2. **Popover** - Opens/closes correctly, no console warnings
3. **Side Panel** - Opens/closes correctly, no console warnings
4. **Accordion** - Expands/collapses correctly, no console warnings
5. **DatePicker** - Calendar popover opens correctly, no console warnings

### Console Warnings Found
- Only 2 warnings present (neither related to React 19 upgrade):
  1. `Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)` for favicon.svg (cosmetic issue)
  2. `Runtime config is deprecated and will be removed in Next.js 16` - related to next/config usage

### Verification
- No `preventFocusOnPress` or other unknown DOM prop warnings
- All overlay components (Popover, SidePanel) use useOverlayTrigger and work correctly
- All button components work correctly without spreading react-aria internal props to DOM

### Notes
- Storybook takes ~90 seconds to build and start
- All React 19 + react-aria 3.45.0 + react-spring 10.0.3 compatibility verified
- Phase 3 testing is now complete

### Next Tasks (Phase 4)
- version-bump
- publish-packages
- update-vanier-mono

## 2026-01-11 - Tasks: fix-directus-flexible-content-types, fix-directus-flexible-content-rendernodes (phase_5_remaining_libs)

### Completed
- Fixed JSX namespace issues in directus-flexible-content library for React 19 compatibility
- Both tasks were completed together since they are tightly coupled (same package)

### Files Changed

1. `libs/directus/directus-flexible-content/src/lib/components/nodes/types.ts`
   - Added `import type React from 'react'`
   - Changed `JSX.IntrinsicElements` to `React.JSX.IntrinsicElements`
   - Changed `JSX.Element` to `React.JSX.Element`
   - Fixed import order and formatting per lint rules

2. `libs/directus/directus-flexible-content/src/lib/components/RenderNodes/index.tsx`
   - Added `import React, { type ReactNode } from 'react'`
   - Changed return type from `FunctionComponent<RenderNodesProps>` to explicit `ReactNode`
   - Changed `JSX.IntrinsicElements` to `React.JSX.IntrinsicElements` in callback parameter
   - Added type cast `tagKey = tag as keyof TRenderingNodes` for index access
   - Added type cast `as={tag as React.ElementType}` for Box component

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build directus-flexible-content` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx lint directus-flexible-content` - SUCCESS (0 errors)

### Issues Encountered
- `FunctionComponent` return type in React 19 is stricter - `renderView` returns `RenderedNode<T>` which doesn't match
- Solution: Changed to explicit `ReactNode` return type annotation
- Lint required regular import of React (not type import) since `React.JSX.IntrinsicElements` and `React.ElementType` are used
- Index access on `TRenderingNodes` required explicit type cast since `tag` could be `string | number | symbol`

### Next Tasks (Phase 5 remaining)
- convert-core-lib-peer-deps
- convert-next-component-peer-deps
- convert-directus-query-peer-deps
- convert-directus-block-peer-deps
- convert-directus-next-component-peer-deps
- convert-directus-flexible-content-peer-deps

## 2026-01-11 - Task: convert-core-lib-peer-deps (phase_5_remaining_libs)

### Completed
- Converted react from dependencies to peerDependencies in core-lib package.json
- This allows consumers to use either React 18 or React 19 with the library

### Changes Made
1. `libs/stack/core-lib/package.json`
   - Removed `"react": "18.3.1"` from dependencies
   - Added peerDependencies section:
     ```json
     "peerDependencies": {
       "react": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"
     }
     ```
   - Added devDependencies section:
     ```json
     "devDependencies": {
       "react": "^19.0.0"
     }
     ```

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build core-lib` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx lint core-lib` - SUCCESS (0 errors)

### Issues Encountered
- None

### Next Tasks (Phase 5 remaining)
- convert-next-component-peer-deps
- convert-directus-query-peer-deps
- convert-directus-block-peer-deps
- convert-directus-next-component-peer-deps
- convert-directus-flexible-content-peer-deps

## 2026-01-11 - Task: convert-next-component-peer-deps (phase_5_remaining_libs)

### Completed
- Converted react from dependencies to peerDependencies in next-component package.json
- Fixed Next.js 15 compatibility issues discovered during build verification
- This allows consumers to use either React 18 or React 19 with the library

### Changes Made
1. `libs/stack/next-component/package.json`
   - Removed `"react": "18.3.1"` from dependencies
   - Added peerDependencies section:
     ```json
     "peerDependencies": {
       "react": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"
     }
     ```
   - Added devDependencies section:
     ```json
     "devDependencies": {
       "react": "^19.0.0"
     }
     ```

2. `libs/stack/next-component/src/hooks/useLink/index.ts`
   - Removed import of `Params` from internal Next.js path `'next/dist/shared/lib/router/utils/route-matcher'`
   - Added local type definition: `type Params = Record<string, string | string[] | undefined>`
   - This fixes the build error where Next.js 15 moved the Params type location

3. `libs/stack/stack-ui/src/types/next-link.ts`
   - Updated `prefetch` prop type from `boolean | null` to `'auto' | 'unstable_forceStale' | boolean | null`
   - This matches Next.js 15's LinkProps which added new prefetch values

### Verification
- Build passed: `npx nx build next-component` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx lint next-component` - SUCCESS (0 errors)
- Build passed: `npx nx build stack-ui` - SUCCESS
- Lint passed: `npx nx lint stack-ui` - SUCCESS (0 errors)

### Issues Encountered
1. **Params type import breaking change**: Next.js 15 moved the Params type from `next/dist/shared/lib/router/utils/route-matcher` to `next/dist/server/request/params`. Rather than depend on internal paths, defined type locally.

2. **prefetch prop type mismatch**: Next.js 15 expanded the prefetch prop to include `'auto'` and `'unstable_forceStale'` values. The TUseLinkReturn interface (which extends NextLinkProps) had these new values but stack-ui's NextLinkProps type only accepted `boolean | null`.

3. **Import order lint error**: Initially placed type definition before imports, triggering `import/first` lint rule. Fixed by moving type definition after all imports.
